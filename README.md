# 🏥 Hospital Patient Analysis: High-Risk Groups & Strategic Recommendations
## 📜 Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of Bright Hospital's patient admission data to identify key demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors driving admissions and readmissions. The analysis covers patient demographics (age, gender), admission types (elective vs. emergency), and several key indicators such as length of stay, number of diagnoses, blood pressure, blood sugar, and previous admission history.
## 🎯 Aim
The primary aim of this analysis is to improve hospital performance and patient care. The findings are used to inform strategic recommendations focused on reducing risks associated with frequent admissions, prolonged Length of Stay (LOS), and clinical irregularities.
## 💡 Key Insights
The analysis revealed several crucial trends across the patient population:
 * Demographics:
   * 🧑 Male patients account for a slightly higher percentage of total admissions (27% Elective, 25% Emergency) compared to female patients (25% Elective, 23% Emergency).
   * 👴 The 'Age Senior' (63-77 years) accounts for the largest share of all hospital admissions (21% of total patient volume).
   * Elective procedures account for over half of these 'Age Senior' admissions (11% of total patient volume).
 * Admission & Readmission Trends:
   * ➡️ Elective admissions have a slightly higher readmission rate (16%) compared to Emergency admissions (15%).
   * ⏳ Patients with a Prolonged Length of Stay (more than 10 days) have a significantly higher readmission rate at 20% than any other LOS group.
   * The average number of diagnoses is consistently 5 across all Length of Stay categories.
   * 🔁 Patients with more than two prior admissions show a readmission rate of 12%, classifying them as the most frequent returners.
 * Clinical Indicators (Blood Pressure & Blood Sugar):
   * 🩸 Patients with Normal blood pressure (0-120) have the highest readmission rate at 15%, followed by those in the Crisis blood pressure range (>139) at 10%.
   * 🍬 Patients with Hyperglycemia (above 125) blood sugar levels have the highest readmission rate overall at 17.2%.
## ✅ Recommendations
The following strategic recommendations are designed to improve patient flow and strengthen care management to reduce risks:
1. Strengthen Post-Discharge Care (Highest Impact)
 * 👩‍⚕️ Assign a Nurse Navigator/Care Coordinator for high-risk patients.
 * 📞 Schedule 48-72 hour follow-up calls and early clinic appointments.
 * 💊 Ensure medication adherence, side-effect monitoring, and patient coaching.
2. Improve Hospital Flow & Reduce Length of Stay (LOS)
 * 📅 Implement an Early Discharge Planning Protocol (start planning on Day 1).
 * 🤝 Use a Multidisciplinary Care Huddle for complex patients.
 * 📉 Reduce delays in labs, imaging, and specialist consultations.
 * 📋 Create a discharge readiness checklist to reduce avoidable delays.
3. Reduce Readmission Risk Through Targeted Clinical Management
 * 🚨 Flag patients with frequent admissions or high BLP/BLS scores as high-risk.
 * 🧪 Standardize care pathways for common chronic conditions (e.g., DM, HTN, HIV/TB).
 * ⚠️ Use an early-warning deterioration system to detect risk earlier.
4. Strengthen Patient Knowledge & Self-Management
 * 📚 Provide condition-specific education before discharge.
 * 📝 Use simplified health coaching materials for chronic disease management.
 * 🚶 Encourage patients to attend follow-up clinics and adhere to treatment plans.
